#MySQL AWS Instance deployment, Ubuntu 22.04 / MySQL 8.1

- This is aimple mysql deployment directly on the instance. 
 Adapt to your needs instance type, region/az etc.


  If you run into any issues running this deployment, it is likely related to content in the vars_files or json scripts.  These are modified for pubic view and not the values as what are called when I'm running these plays. Most shouldn't matter.
