###> First this container needs to be created and started.
###> During the first start the default.conf file is written to /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf.
###> Do not recreate the container from image when adding php-fpm in the later step. The conf file will be created again over anything copied there.
###> Other options are to define the a different conf file with the hostname/fqdn, etc.
